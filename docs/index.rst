Notes from the Continuous Integration Course
===========================

Continuous Integration lets you automatically build, test, and deploy your code.
We looked at how to set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions, and how to use
coverage tools to measure the effectiveness of your tests. 

The code which we practiced with says hello, which is something.

I think that branch coverage is a good idea, since it lets you see which parts of your code (in all cases) will and will not be executed.
